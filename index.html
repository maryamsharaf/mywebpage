<h1>Picking the Perfect Pup</h1>
<p>The perfect puppy, in my opinion, is the shy, small, and least likely to be picked since 
  they are different from the rest of the litter; their precious souls only want to be loved,
  and we humans must be there for them. They'll exhibit their enjoyment once they've gotten acclimated 
  to you. "They might only be there for a part of your life, but to them you are their whole life."</p>
