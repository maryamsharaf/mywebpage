<h1>Picking the Perfect Pup</h1>
<p>The perfect puppy, in my opinion, is the shy, small, and least likely to be picked since they are different<br> from the rest of the 
 litter; their precious souls only want to be loved, and we humans must be there for<br> them. They'll exhibit their enjoyment once they've gotten acclimated 
  to you. "They might only be there for a part of your<br> life, but to them you are their whole life."</p>
